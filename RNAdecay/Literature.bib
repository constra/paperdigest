	biological processes at a molecular level. However, significant time
	and effort are still required to solve and complete many of these
	structures because of the need for manual interpretation of complex
	numerical data using many software packages and the repeated use
	of interactive three-dimensional graphics. PHENIX has been developed
	to provide a comprehensive system for macromolecular crystallographic
	structure solution with an emphasis on the automation of all procedures.
	This has relied on the development of algorithms that minimize or
	eliminate subjective input, the development of algorithms that automate
	procedures that are traditionally performed by hand and, finally,
	the development of a framework that allows a tight integration between
	the algorithms.},

	have a profound influence on transcription from the underlying genes.
	We have previously shown that the disassembly of promoter nucleosomes
	is obligatory for activation of the yeast PHO5 and PHO8 genes. Here,
	we show that the PHO5 promoter nucleosomes are reassembled concomitant
	with transcriptional repression and displacement of the TATA binding
	protein and {RNA} polymerase II ({RNA} Pol II). We identify the histone
	H3-H4 chaperone Spt6 as the factor that mediates nucleosome reassembly
	onto the PHO5, PHO8, ADH2, ADY2, and SUC2 promoters during transcriptional
	repression. Furthermore, promoter nucleosome reassembly is essential
	for transcriptional repression. In the absence of Spt6-mediated nucleosome
	reassembly, the activators Pho4 and Pho2 are displaced from the PHO5
	promoter in repressing conditions, yet transcription is sustained.
	As such, these studies demonstrate that activators are not required
	for transcription in the absence of competing chromatin reassembly.},

	a component of the decapping machinery conserved in eukaryotes, the
	transcript coding the ribosomal protein Rps28b is specifically stabilized,
	as demonstrated by microarray and time course experiments. This stabilization
	results from the loss of RPS28B autoregulation, which occurs at the

	of Edc3, directly recruits the decapping machinery on its own m{RNA}.
	These findings show that specific modulation of the decapping efficiency

	CCR4 and CAF1, in turn, physically interacted with NOT1 through its

	a function of the activation of biological categories. Probabilistic

	respond to molecular signals within cells. Natural riboswitches are
	employed to regulate metabolism and other cellular processes, while
	synthetic riboswitches have been constructed to expand the sensory
	and regulatory capabilities exhibited in nature. Characterization
	studies have revealed that sequence modifications can tune properties
	of the riboswitch response curve, which links ligand concentration
	to expression levels. Tunability is critical when matching component
	properties to the regulatory demands of biological systems; however,
	the characterization of riboswitch tuning strategies is complicated
	by the integration of numerous regulatory mechanisms and various
	processes, such as {RNA} folding and turnover, that impact riboswitch
	performance. To develop a generalized framework for examining quantitative
	aspects of riboswitch tuning, we modeled the kinetics of riboswitch
	function operating under common regulatory mechanisms. Our results
	reveal that riboswitch performance is primarily dictated by the competition
	between reversible and mechanism-specific irreversible rate constants.
	We demonstrate that practical system restrictions can significantly
	alter the requirements for riboswitch performance, necessitating
	a variety of tuning strategies. We developed design principles to
	guide the construction of synthetic riboswitches and a quantitative

  abstract = {PUF proteins are eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins that repress specific
	mRNAs. The mechanisms and co-repressors involved in PUF repression
	remain to be fully identified. Here, we investigated the mode of
	repression by yeast Puf5p and Puf4p and found that Puf5p specifically
	requires Eap1p to repress mRNAs, whereas Puf4p does not. Surprisingly,
	we observed that Eap1p, which is a member of the eIF4E-binding protein
	(4E-BP) class of translational inhibitors, does not inhibit the efficient
	poly-ribosome association of a Puf5p target mRNA. Rather, we found
	that Eap1p accelerates mRNA degradation by promoting decapping and
	the ability of Eap1p to interact with eIF4E facilitates this activity.
	Deletion of EAP1 dramatically reduces decapping, resulting in accumulation

	associates both with Puf5p and the Dhh1p decapping factor. Furthermore,
	recruitment of Eap1p to down-regulated mRNA is mediated by Puf5p.
	Based on these results, we propose that Puf5p promotes decapping
	by recruiting Eap1p and associated decapping factors to mRNAs. The
	implication of these findings is that a 4E-BP can repress protein

	recognition site and stimulate decapping by 1000-fold, affecting
	both the KM for mRNA and rate of the catalytic step. The C-terminus
	of Edc1 is necessary and sufficient to enhance the catalytic step,

	UASs of a reporter gene without altering the transcript sequence
	affects the transcript's decay kinetics. A short cis element, comprising
	two Rap1p-binding sites, and Rap1p itself, are necessary and sufficient
	to induce enhanced decay of the reporter mRNA. Furthermore, Rap1p
	stimulates both the synthesis and the decay ofÂ a specific population
	of endogenous mRNAs. We propose that Rap1p association with target
	promoter in the nucleus affects the composition of the exported mRNP,
	which in turn regulates mRNA decay in the cytoplasm. Thus, promoters
	can play key roles in determining mRNA levels and have the capacity
	to coordinate rates of mRNA synthesis and decay.},

	The transitions between polysomes and P-bodies and how the poly(A)
	tail and the associated poly(A) binding protein 1 (Pab1p) may affect
	this process are unknown. Herein, we provide evidence that poly(A)(+)
	m{RNA}s can enter P-bodies in yeast. First, we show that both poly(A)(-)

	poly(A)(+) transcripts and/or Pab1p can be detected in P-bodies during

	have enlarged P-bodies, suggesting that Pab1p plays a direct or indirect
	role in shifting the equilibrium of m{RNA}s away from P-bodies and
	into translation, perhaps by aiding in the assembly of a type of
	mRNP within P-bodies that is poised to reenter translation. Consistent
	with this latter possibility, we observed the translation initiation

	and interpret quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments. The
	problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail
	in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate
	critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the
	experiments. Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of
	Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the
	reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific
	literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase
	experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe
	the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments.
	Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a
	manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental
	conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity
	of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences,
	and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to
	reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated
	form or as an online supplement. Summary: Following these guidelines
	will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable
	and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.},

	decapping. Moreover, mutations that inhibit m{RNA} turnover suppress
	the inviability of a pab1 delta mutation, suggesting that premature
	m{RNA} decapping in pab1 delta strains contributes to cell death.
	Second, we find that Pab1p is not required for deadenylation, although
	in its absence poly(A) tail shortening rates are significantly reduced.
	In addition, in the absence of Pab1p, newly synthesized m{RNA}s had
	poly(A) tails longer than those in wild-type strains and showed an
	unexpected temporal delay prior to the initiation of deadenylation

	a yeast strain by introducing a homing (Ho) endonuclease cut site

	3â€² end of the coding sequence of a highly active gene, ADH1. This
	yeast strain also contains the Ho cut site at the nearly silent or

	under the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. Using this strain, DSBs
	were generated at the ADH1 and MATÎ± loci in galactose-containing
	growth medium that induced HO expression. Subsequently, yeast cells
	were transferred to dextrose-containing growth medium to stop HO
	expression, and the DSB repair was monitored at the ADH1 and MATÎ±
	loci by PCR, using the primer pairs flanking the Ho cut sites. Our

  abstract = {Degradation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) plays an essential role in modulation
	of gene expression and in quality control of mRNA biogenesis. Nearly
	all major mRNA decay pathways characterized thus far in eukaryotes
	are initiated by deadenylation, i.e., shortening of the mRNA 3â€²
	poly(A) tail. Deadenylation is often a rate-limiting step for mRNA
	degradation and translational silencing, making it an important control
	point for both processes. In this review, we discuss the fundamental
	principles that govern mRNA deadenylation in eukaryotes. We use several
	major mRNA decay pathways in mammalian cells to illustrate mechanisms
	and regulation of deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay, including decay
	directed by adenine/uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3â€²-untranslated
	region (UTR), the rapid decay mediated by destabilizing elements
	in protein-coding regions, the surveillance mechanism that detects
	and degrades nonsense-containing mRNA [i.e., nonsense-mediated decay
	(NMD)], the decay directed by miRNAs, and the default decay pathway
	for stable messages. Mammalian mRNA deadenylation involves two consecutive
	phases mediated by the PAN2â€“PAN3 and the CCR4â€“CAF1 complexes,
	respectively. Decapping takes place after deadenylation and may serve
	as a backup mechanism to trigger mRNA decay if initial deadenylation
	is compromised. In addition, we discuss how deadenylation impacts
	the dynamics of RNA processing bodies (P-bodies), where nontranslatable
	mRNAs can be degraded or stored. Possible models for mechanisms of
	various deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay pathways are also discussed.

	originally identified as one class of extragenic suppressors of Ty
	and delta insertion mutations in the 5' noncoding regions of HIS4
	and LYS2. We cloned SPT6 and constructed a null allele by gene disruption.
	Haploid spores carrying the spt6 null allele were inviable, indicating
	that the SPT6 gene is essential for mitotic growth. SPT6 was mapped
	to the right arm of chromosome VII, 44 centimorgans (cM) from ADE6
	and 9 cM from CLY8. We showed that spt6 mutations suppress delta
	insertion mutations at the level of transcription but have no qualitative
	or quantitative effect on Ty transcription. In addition, we observed
	interesting SPT6 gene dosage effects. An SPT6 strain containing a
	high-copy-number plasmid clone of SPT6 showed suppression of delta
	insertion mutations, and a diploid strain with half its normal dose
	of SPT6 (SPT6/spt6 null) also exhibited suppression of delta insertion
	mutations. Therefore, having either too many or too few copies of
	SPT6 causes a mutant phenotype. Finally, this study and that in the
	accompanying paper (L. Neigeborn, J. L. Celenza, and M. Carlson,
	Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:679-686, 1986) showed that spt6 and ssn20 mutations
	(isolated as suppressors of snf2 and snf5 [sucrose nonfermenting]
	mutations) identify the same gene. SPT6 and SSN20 have the same genetic
	map position and share an identical restriction map. Furthermore,
	spt6 and ssn20 mutations fail to complement each other, and ssn20
	mutations suppress solo delta insertion mutations at HIS4 and LYS2.
	These results, taken in conjunction with the SPT6 dosage effects
	and the fact that SPT6 is an essential gene, suggest that SPT6 plays
	a fundamental role in cellular transcription, perhaps by interaction
	with other transcription factors.},

	characterized functions. It is a histone chaperone capable of reassembling
	nucleosomes, a central component of transcription elongation complexes,
	and is required for recruitment of RNA processing factors to elongating
	RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Here, we report multiple crystal structures
	of the 168-kDa Spt6 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that together
	represent essentially all of the ordered sequence. Our two structures
	of the âˆ¼&#xa0;900-residue core region reveal a series of putative
	nucleic acid and proteinâ€“protein interaction domains that fold
	into an elongated form that resembles the bacterial protein Tex.
	The similarity to a bacterial transcription factor suggests that
	the core domain performs nucleosome-independent activities, and as
	with Tex, we find that Spt6 binds DNA. Unlike Tex, however, the Spt6
	S1 domain does not contribute to this activity. Crystal structures
	of the Spt6 C-terminal region reveal a tandem SH2 domain structure
	composed of two closely associated SH2 folds. One of these SH2 folds
	is cryptic, while the other shares striking structural similarity
	with metazoan SH2 domains and possesses structural features associated
	with the ability to bind phosphorylated substrates including phosphotyrosine.
	Binding studies with phosphopeptides that mimic the RNAPII C-terminal
	domain revealed affinities typical of other RNAPII C-terminal domain-binding
	proteins but did not indicate a specific interaction. Overall, these
	findings provide a structural foundation for understanding how Spt6
	encodes several distinct functions within a single polypeptide chain.},

	of the 3′ poly(A) tail, followed either by cleavage of the 5′ cap
	structure (decapping) and 5′->3′ exonucleolytic digestion, or by
	3′ to 5′ degradation. m{RNA} decapping represents a critical step
	in turnover because this permits the degradation of the m{RNA} and
	is a site of numerous control inputs. Recent analyses suggest decapping
	of an m{RNA} consists of four central and related events. These include
	removal, or inactivation, of the poly(A) tail as an inhibitor of
	decapping, exit from active translation, assembly of a decapping
	complex on the m{RNA}, and sequestration of the m{RNA} into discrete
	cytoplasmic foci where decapping can occur. Each of these steps is
	a demonstrated, or potential, site for the regulation of m{RNA} decay.
	We discuss the decapping process in the light of these central properties,
	which also suggest fundamental aspects of cytoplasmic m{RNA} physiology
	that connect decapping, translation, and storage of m{RNA}. },

	with the bioinformatically defined Sas10/C1D domain, which was sufficient
	for protein function in vivo. In vitro protein interaction studies

	Rrp6. Expression of the N-terminal domain of Rrp47 in yeast complemented
	most RNA-processing defects associated with the rrp47Î” mutant but
	failed to complement the defect observed in 3â€²-end maturation of
	box C/D small nucleolar RNAs. Consistent with these results, protein
	capture assays revealed an interaction between the C-terminal region
	of Rrp47 and the small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins Nop56 and Nop58.
	Filter binding assays demonstrated that deletion of the lysine-rich
	sequence at the C terminus of Rrp47 blocked RNA binding in vitro.
	Furthermore, a protein mutated both at the C terminus and within
	the N-terminal domain showed a synergistic defect in RNA binding
	without impacting on its ability to interact with Rrp6. These studies
	provide evidence for a role of Rrp47 in registering a small nucleolar
	ribonucleoprotein particle assembly, functionally characterize the
	Sas10/C1D domain of Rrp47, and show that both the C terminus of Rrp47
	and the N-terminal domain contribute to its RNA-binding activity.},

	with DNA template-primer [Pelletier, H., Sawaya, M.R., Kumar, A.,
	Wilson, S.H. and Kraut, J. (1994) Science 264, 1891-1903] and with
	biochemical data. Five crystal structures of predicted HhH motifs
	are currently known: two from rat pol beta and one each in endonuclease
	III, AlkA and the 5' nuclease domain of Taq pol I. These motifs are
	more structurally similar to each other than to any other structure
	in current databases, including helix-turn-helix motifs. The clustering
	of the five HhH structures separately from other bi-helical structures
	in searches indicates that all members of the 14 families of proteins
	described herein possess similar HhH structures. By analogy with
	the rat pol beta structure, it is suggested that each of these HhH
	motifs bind DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner, via the formation
	of hydrogen bonds between protein backbone nitrogens and DNA phosphate
	groups. This type of interaction contrasts with the sequence-specific
	interactions of other motifs, including helix-turn-helix structures.
	Additional evidence is provided that alphaherpesvirus virion host
	shutoff proteins are members of the polymerase I 5'-nuclease and
	FEN1-like endonuclease gene family, and that a novel HhH-containing
	DNA-binding domain occurs in the kinesin-like molecule nod, and in
	other proteins such as cnjB, emb-5 and SPT6.},

	the cell is important to ensure, for instance, timely cellular responses
	to changes in the environment. mRNA transcription and mRNA degradation
	directly affect mRNA levels and it would make sense to have a system
	in place that would coordinate these opposing processes. Previous
	studies suggested that regulation of transcription in the nucleus
	may be linked to regulation of mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm,
	yet the details of this connection are poorly understood. In this
	study, we took an evolutionary approach to address this question
	by comparing both transcription and mRNA degradation between two
	yeast species. We found that evolution of these distinct processes
	is coordinated, as genes that diverged in mRNA degradation tend to
	also diverge in transcription. Interestingly, the coordination is
	counterproductive, as increased transcription is linked to increased
	mRNA degradation. We analyzed a hybrid between the two yeast species
	to classify evolutionary differences according to the type of underlying
	mutation (<italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>). This analysis
	indicated that coordinated changes in transcription and mRNA degradation
	are likely to be driven by the same individual mutations, and thus
	directly coupled. Finally, we suggest several mechanisms that may
	mediate this coupling, including complexes which are involved in
	both processes (Rpb4/7 and Ccr4-Not) and promoter regulatory regions.
	These results suggest that a direct coupling between the regulation
	of transcription and mRNA degradation is a common phenomenon employed
	by approximately 10% of the genes in yeast.</p>},

	the PUF family of proteins, facilitates association of Arp2/3 complex
	to yeast mitochondria. Jsn1p localizes to punctate structures that
	align along mitochondria, cofractionates with a mitochondrial marker

	and carbonate extractable in isolated mitochondria. Thus, Jsn1p is
	a peripheral membrane protein that is associated with the outer leaflet
	of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Jsn1p colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated
	with mitochondria-associated Arc18p-GFP, and purified Arp2/3 complex
	bound to isolated TAP-tagged Jsn1p. Moreover, deletion of JSN1 reduces
	the amount of Arc18p-GFP that colocalizes and is recovered with mitochondria
	twofold, and jsn1{Delta} cells exhibited defects in mitochondrial
	morphology and motility similar to those observed in Arp2/3 complex

	of upstream antisense transcription in regions encoding transcription
	start site associated RNAs (TSSa-RNAs) at four divergent CpG island
	promoters: Isg20l1, Tcea1, Txn1, and Sf3b1. We find that upstream
	antisense RNAs (uaRNAs) have distinct capped 5â€² termini and heterogeneous
	nonpolyadenylated 3â€² ends. uaRNAs are short-lived with average
	half-lives of 18Â minutes and are present at 1â€“4 copies per cell,
	approximately one RNA per DNA template. Exosome depletion stabilizes
	uaRNAs. These uaRNAs are probably initiation products because their
	capped termini correlate with peaks of paused RNAPII. The pausing
	factors NELF and DSIF are associated with these antisense polymerases
	and their sense partners. Knockdown of either NELF or DSIF results
	in an increase in the levels of uaRNAs. Consistent with P-TEFb controlling
	release from pausing, treatment with its inhibitor, flavopiridol,
	decreases uaRNA and nascent mRNA transcripts with similar kinetics.
	Finally, Isg20l1 induction reveals equivalent increases in transcriptional
	activity in sense and antisense directions. Together these data show
	divergent polymerases are regulated after P-TEFb recruitment with

	We show that the integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, and

	promote the cellular sensitivity to rapamycin. However, increased
	levels of vacuolar protease could enhance resistance to rapamycin.
	Of the 85 proteins identified as statistically significantly changing

	levels of &gt;100 lncRNAs in yeast are controlled by decapping and

	We find many lncRNAs degraded by DCP2 are expressed proximal to inducible
	genes. Of these, we show several genes required for galactose utilization
	are associated with lncRNAs that have expression patterns inversely
	correlated with their mRNA counterpart. Moreover, decapping of these
	lncRNAs is critical for rapid and robust induction of GAL gene expression.
	Failure to destabilize a lncRNA known to exert repressive histone
	modifications results in perpetuation of a repressive chromatin state
	that contributes to reduced plasticity of gene activation. We propose
	that decapping and lncRNA degradation serve a vital role in transcriptional

	The yeast PUF protein, Mpt5p, regulates HO m{RNA} and stimulates
	removal of its poly(A) tail (i.e. deadenylation). Mpt5p repression
	in vivo is dependent on POP2, a component of the cytoplasmic Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not
	complex that deadenylates m{RNA}s. In this study, we elucidate the
	individual roles of the Ccr4p and Pop2p deadenylases in Mpt5p-regulated
	deadenylation. Both in vivo and in vitro, Pop2p and Ccr4p proteins
	are required for Mpt5p-regulated deadenylation of HO. However, the
	requirements for the two proteins differ dramatically: the enzymatic
	activity of Ccr4p is essential, whereas that of Pop2p is dispensable.
	We conclude that Pop2p is a bridge through which the PUF protein
	recruits the Ccr4p enzyme to the target m{RNA}, thereby stimulating
	deadenylation. Our data suggest that PUF proteins may enhance m{RNA}
	degradation and repress expression by both deadenylation-dependent
	and -independent mechanisms, using the same Pop2p bridge to recruit
	a multifunctional Pop2p complex to the m{RNA}.},

  abstract = {Gene expression in eukaryotes is an essential process that includes
	transcription, RNA processing and export. One important player in
	this interface is the poly(A)+-RNA binding protein Nab2, which regulates
	the mRNA poly(A)+-tail length and export. Here we show that Nab2
	has additional roles during mRNA transcription, tRNA metabolism and
	ribosomal subunits export. Nab2 associates with all over the open
	reading frame of actively transcribed RNA polymerase (RNAP) II and
	III genes. As a consequence, nab2 mutations confer translation defects
	that are detected by polysome profiling. Genome-wide analysis of
	expression of a conditional degron nab2 mutant shows that the role
	of Nab2 in RNAPII transcription and RNAPIII metabolism is direct.
	Altogether, our results identify novel functions for Nab2 in transcription
	and metabolism of most types of RNAs, indicating that Nab2 function
	is more ubiquitous than previously anticipated, being a central player
	in the general and coordinated control of gene expression from transcription
	to translation.},

	Efficient translation in the cytoplasm depends on association of
	Rpb4/7 with {RNA} polymerase II (Pol II) in the nucleus, leading
	to a model in which Pol II remotely controls translation. Hence,
	like in prokaryotes, the eukaryotic translation is coupled to transcription.

	the abundances of thousands of m{RNA}s in biological samples. Comparability
	of array results is necessary for the creation of large-scale gene
	expression databases. The standard strategy for normalizing oligonucleotide
	array readouts has practical drawbacks. We describe alternative normalization
	procedures for oligonucleotide arrays based on a common pool of known
	biotin-labeled c{RNA}s spiked into each hybridization.RESULTS:We
	first explore the conditions for validity of the 'constant mean assumption',
	the key assumption underlying current normalization methods. We introduce
	'frequency normalization', a 'spike-in'-based normalization method
	which estimates array sensitivity, reduces background noise and allows
	comparison between array designs. This approach does not rely on
	the constant mean assumption and so can be effective in conditions
	where standard procedures fail. We also define 'scaled frequency',
	a hybrid normalization method relying on both spiked transcripts
	and the constant mean assumption while maintaining all other advantages
	of frequency normalization. We compare these two procedures to a
	standard global normalization method using experimental data. We
	also use simulated data to estimate accuracy and investigate the
	effects of noise. We find that scaled frequency is as reproducible
	and accurate as global normalization while offering several practical
	advantages.CONCLUSIONS:Scaled frequency quantitation is a convenient,
	reproducible technique that performs as well as global normalization
	on serial experiments with the same array design, while offering
	several additional features. Specifically, the scaled-frequency method
	enables the comparison of expression measurements across different
	array designs, yields estimates of absolute message abundance in
	c{RNA} and determines the sensitivity of individual arrays.},

  abstract = {Analysis of the slowed turnover rates of several specific m{RNA} species
	and the higher cellular levels of some of these m{RNA}s in Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae lacking 5'-->3' exoribonuclease 1 (xrn1 cells) has led
	to the finding that these yeast contain higher amounts of essentially
	full-length m{RNA}s that do not bind to oligo(dT)-cellulose. On the
	other hand, the length of m{RNA} poly(A) chains found after pulse-labeling
	of cells lacking the exoribonuclease, the cellular rate of synthesis
	of oligo(dT)-bound m{RNA}, and the initial rate of its deadenylation
	appeared quite similar to the same measurements in wild-type yeast
	cells. Examination of the 5' cap structure status of the poly(A)-deficient
	m{RNA}s by comparative analysis of the m7G content of poly(A)- and
	poly(A)+ {RNA} fractions of wild-type and xrn1 cells suggested that
	the xrn1 poly(A)- m{RNA} fraction is low in cap structure content.
	Further analysis of the 5' termini by measurements of the rate of
	5'-->3' exoribonuclease 1 hydrolysis of specific full-length m{RNA}
	species showed that approximately 50% of the xrn1 poly(A)-deficient
	m{RNA} species lack the cap structure. Primer extension analysis
	of the 5' terminus of ribosomal protein 51A (RP51A) m{RNA} showed
	that about 30% of the poly(A)-deficient molecules of the xrn1 cells
	are slightly shorter at the 5' end. The finding of some accumulation
	of poly(A)-deficient m{RNA} species partially lacking the cap structure
	together with the reduction of the rate of m{RNA} turnover in cells
	lacking the enzyme suggest a possible role for 5'-->3' exoribonuclease
	1 in the m{RNA} turnover process.},

	TetR binding and in vivo screening for TetR induction. The smallest
	active aptamer folds into a stem-loop with an internal loop interrupting
	the stem. Mutational analysis in vivo and in-line probing in vitro
	reveal this loop to be the protein binding site. The TetR-inducing
	activity of the aptamer directly correlates with its stability and
	the best construct is as efficient as the natural inducer tetracycline.
	Because of its small size, high induction efficiency, and the stability
	of the TetR aptamer under in vivo conditions, it is well suited to
	be an alternative {RNA}-based inducer of TetR-controlled gene expression.},

	exoribonuclease Xrn1 targets cytoplasmic RNA substrates marked by
	a 5â€² monophosphate for processive 5â€²-to-3â€² degradation by an
	unknown mechanism. Here, we report the crystal structure of an Xrn1-substrate
	complex. The single-stranded substrate is held in place by stacking
	of the 5â€²-terminal trinucleotide between aromatic side chains while
	a highly basic pocket specifically recognizes the 5â€² phosphate.
	Mutations of residues involved in binding the 5â€²-terminal nucleotide
	impair Xrn1 processivity. The substrate recognition mechanism allows
	Xrn1 to couple processive hydrolysis to duplex melting in RNA substrates
	with sufficiently long single-stranded 5â€² overhangs. The Xrn1-substrate
	complex structure thus rationalizes the exclusive specificity of
	Xrn1 for 5â€²-monophosphorylated substrates, ensuring fidelity of
	mRNA turnover, and posits a model for translocation-coupled unwinding
	of structured RNA substrates.},

	We therefore used antibody-independent methods to study CTDK-I, and

	is either unphosphorylated or prephosphorylated at Ser2. When Ser5
	is already phosphorylated, CTDK-I phosphorylates Ser2 of the CTD.
	We also observed that CTDK-I efficiently generates doubly phosphorylated

	are more readily phosphorylated CTDK-I than unphosphorylby ated CTD

  abstract = {Regulation of tau exon 10 splicing plays an important role in tauopathy.
	One of the cis elements regulating tau alternative splicing is a
	stem-loop structure at the 5' splice site of tau exon 10. The RNA
	helicase(s) modulating this stem-loop structure was unknown. We searched
	for splicing regulators interacting with this stem-loop region using
	an RNA affinity pulldown-coupled mass spectrometry approach and identified
	DDX5/RNA helicase p68 as an activator of tau exon 10 splicing. The
	activity of p68 in stimulating tau exon 10 inclusion is dependent
	on RBM4, an intronic splicing activator. RNase H cleavage and U1
	protection assays suggest that p68 promotes conformational change
	of the stem-loop structure, thereby increasing the access of U1snRNP
	to the 5' splice site of tau exon 10. This study reports the first
	RNA helicase interacting with a stem-loop structure at the splice
	site and regulating alternative splicing in a helicase-dependent
	manner. Our work uncovers a previously unknown function of p68 in
	regulating tau exon 10 splicing. Furthermore, our experiments reveal
	functional interaction between two splicing activators for tau exon
	10, p68 binding at the stem-loop region and RBM4 interacting with
	the intronic splicing enhancer region.},

  abstract = {Summary Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is one mechanism that regulates
	translation in early animal development. In Xenopus oocytes, polyadenylation
	of dormant m{RNA}s, including cyclin B1, is controlled by the cis-acting
	cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) and hexanucleotide AAUAAA
	through associations with CPEB and CPSF, respectively. Previously,
	we demonstrated that the scaffold protein symplekin contacts CPEB
	and CPSF and helps them interact with Gld2, a poly(A) polymerase.
	Here, we report the mechanism by which poly(A) tail length is regulated.
	Cyclin B1 pre-m{RNA} acquires a long poly(A) tail in the nucleus
	that is subsequently shortened in the cytoplasm. The shortening is
	controlled by CPEB and PARN, a poly(A)-specific ribonuclease. Gld2
	and PARN both reside in the CPEB-containing complex. However, because
	PARN is more active than Gld2, the poly(A) tail is short. When oocytes
	mature, CPEB phosphorylation causes PARN to be expelled from the
	ribonucleoprotein complex, which allows Gld2 to elongate poly(A)
	by default.},

	Other developmental processes disrupted in SBU2 mutants include tail

	(tc) binding to aptamers introduced into their 5'UTRs. Exploiting
	direct {RNA}-ligand interaction renders auxiliary protein factors
	unnecessary. Therefore, our approach is strain independent and not
	susceptible to interferences by heterologous expressed regulatory
	proteins. We use a simple PCR-based strategy, which allows easy tagging
	of any target gene and the level of gene expression can be adjusted
	due to various tc aptamer-regulated promoters. As proof of concept,
	five differently expressed genes were targeted, two of which could
	not be regulated previously. In all cases, adding tc completely prevented
	growth and, as shown for Nop14p, rapidly abolished de novo protein
	synthesis providing a powerful tool for conditional regulation of
	yeast gene expression.},

	remain ambiguous. The discovery that Ccr4/Pop2 is the major cytoplasmic
	mRNA deadenylase and the detection of Not proteins within mRNA processing
	bodies have raised questions about the roles of the Ccr4â€“Not complex
	in transcription. Here we firmly establish Ccr4â€“Not as a positive
	elongation factor for RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The Ccr4â€“Not
	complex is targeted to the coding region of genes in a transcription-dependent
	manner similar to RNAPII and promotes elongation in vivo. Furthermore,
	Ccr4â€“Not interacts directly with elongating RNAPII complexes and
	stimulates transcription elongation of arrested polymerase in vitro.
	Ccr4â€“Not can reactivate backtracked RNAPII using a mechanism different
	from that of the well-characterized elongation factor TFIIS. While
	not essential for its interaction with elongation complexes, Ccr4â€“Not
	interacts with the emerging transcript and promotes elongation in
	a manner dependent on transcript length, although this interaction
	is not required for it to bind RNAPII. Our comprehensive analysis
	shows that Ccr4â€“Not directly regulates transcription, and suggests
	it does so by promoting the resumption of elongation of arrested
	RNAPII when it encounters transcriptional blocks in vivo.},

	The MFA2 m{RNA} is unstable solely because its 3' UTR promotes the

	important in regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. In the general

	decapping is the central step because it is the controlling gate
	preceding the actual degradation of mRNA and is a site of numerous
	control inputs. Removal of the cap structure is catalyzed by a decapping
	holoenzyme composed of the catalytic Dcp2 subunit and the coactivator
	Dcp1. Decapping is regulated by decapping activators and inhibitors.
	Recent structural and kinetics studies indicated that Dcp1 and the

	step of decapping is rate limiting and accelerated by Dcp1. The conformational
	change between the open and closed decapping enzyme is important

  abstract = {With a simple tandem iterated sequence, the C-terminal domain (CTD)
	of eukaryotic {RNA} polymerase II serves as the central coordinator
	of m{RNA} synthesis by harmonizing a diversity of sequential interactions
	with transcription and processing factors. Despite intense research
	interest, many key questions regarding functional and evolutionary
	constraints on the CTD remain unanswered; for example, what selects
	for the canonical heptad sequence, its tandem array across organismal
	diversity and constant CTD length within given species and finally,
	how a sequence-identical, repetitive structure can orchestrate a
	diversity of simultaneous and sequential, stage-dependent interactions
	with both modifying enzymes and binding partners? Here we examine
	comparative sequence evolution of 58 {RNA}P II CTDs from diverse
	taxa representing all six major eukaryotic super-groups and employ
	integrated evolutionary genetic, biochemical and biophysical analyses
	of the yeast CTD to further clarify how this repetitive sequence
	must be organized for optimal {RNA}P II function. We find that the
	CTD is composed of indivisible and independent functional units that
	span diheptapeptides and not only a flexible conformation around
	each unit but also an elastic overall structure is required. More
	remarkably, optimal CTD function always is achieved at approximately
	WT CTD length rather than number of functional units, regardless
	of the characteristics of the sequence present. Our combined observations
	lead us to advance an updated CTD working model, in which functional,
	and therefore evolutionary constraints require a flexible CTD conformation
	determined by the CTD sequence and tandem register to accommodate
	the diversity of CTD-protein interactions and a specific CTD length
	rather than number of functional units to correctly order and organize
	global CTD-protein interactions. Patterns of conservation of these
	features across evolutionary diversity have important implications
	for comparative {RNA}P II function in eukaryotes, and can more clearly
	direct specific research on CTD function in currently under-studied
	organisms.},

	pathway of the eukaryotic mRNA decay initiates with shortening of
	the mRNA poly(A) tail (deadenylation), followed by removal of the
	mRNA 5â€² cap structure and its subsequent exonucleolytic degradation.
	Here we report that a subunit of RNA polymerase II, Rpb4p, is required
	for the decay of a class of mRNAs whose products are involved in
	protein synthesis. Cells lacking RPB4 are defective in the deadenylation
	and post-deadenylation steps of representatives of this class of
	mRNAs. Moreover, Rpb4p interacts with both the mRNP and with subunits
	of the mRNA decay complex Pat1/Lsm1â€“7 that enhances decapping.
	Consistently, a portion of Rpb4p is localized in P bodies, where
	mRNA decapping and degradation is executed, and mutations in RPB4
	increase the number of P bodies per cell. We propose that Rpb4p has
	a dual function in mRNA decay. It promotes or enhances the deadenylation
	process of specific mRNAs and recruits Pat1/Lsm1â€“7 to these mRNAs,
	thus stimulating their decapping and further decay. In this way,
	Rpb4p might link the activity of the basal transcription apparatus

	3â€² to 5â€² degradation. Rpb7p is a Pol II subunit that shuttles
	between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here, we show that Rpb7p is
	involved in the two mRNA decay pathways and possibly couples them.
	Rpb7p stimulates the deadenylation stage required for execution of
	both pathways. Additionally, Rpb7p is both an active component of
	the P bodies, where decapping and 5â€² to 3â€² degradation occur,

	hormone Î²-estradiol, cytoplasmic GEV localizes to the nucleus and
	binds to promoters containing Gal4p consensus binding sequences to

	of only a few dozen genes. Response to inducer is graded: intermediate
	concentrations of inducer result in production of intermediate levels

  abstract = {Puf proteins are regulators of diverse eukaryotic processes including
	stem cell maintenance, organelle biogenesis, oogenesis, neuron function,
	and memory formation. At the molecular level, Puf proteins promote
	translational repression and/or degradation of target mRNAs by first
	interacting with conserved cis-elements in the 3â€² untranslated
	region (UTR). Once bound to an mRNA, Puf proteins elicit RNA repression
	by complex interactions with protein cofactors and regulatory machinery
	involved in translation and degradation. Recent work has dramatically
	increased our understanding of the targets of Puf protein regulation,
	as well as the mechanisms by which Puf proteins recognize and regulate
	those mRNA targets. Crystal structure analysis of several Pufâ€“RNA
	complexes has demonstrated that while Puf proteins are extremely
	conserved in their RNA-binding domains, Pufs attain target specificity
	by utilizing different structural conformations to recognize 8â€“10
	nt sequences. Puf proteins have also evolved modes of protein interactions
	that are organism and transcript-specific, yet two common mechanisms
	of repression have emerged: inhibition of cap-binding events to block
	translation initiation, and recruitment of the CCR4â€“POP2â€“NOT
	deadenylase complex for poly(A) tail removal. Finally, multiple schemes
	to regulate Puf protein activity have been identified, including
	post-translational mechanisms that allow rapid changes in the repression
	of mRNA targets. WIREs RNA 2011 2 471â€“492 DOI: 10.1002/wrna.69For

	Interaction of the poly(A) binding protein, Pab1p, with m{RNA} plays
	an important role in gene expression. This work describes an analysis
	of pab1 mutants in \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}. Yeast pab1
	mutants were found to be sensitive to elevated concentrations of
	copper (Cu) and 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) in the growth medium. This
	phenotype arises because these pab1 mutants underaccumulate m{RNA},
	including the CUP1 and HIS3 m{RNA}s, the products of which are required
	for Cu and 3-AT resistance, respectively. To determine the cause
	of the m{RNA} underaccumulation, m{RNA} turnover and production were
	examined in the pab1-53 mutant. It was found that although the pattern
	of m{RNA} decay was altered, and substantial decapping of polyadenylated
	m{RNA} could be detected, m{RNA} was not destabilized in this strain.
	It was also found that the pab1 mutant was impaired in the production
	of m{RNA}. These data show that the decreased level of m{RNA} in
	the pab1-53 mutant arises from poor production, and they suggest
	that yeast Pab1p is involved in an aspect of nuclear m{RNA} metabolism.
	They also indicate that deadenylation can be uncoupled from decapping
	without significant changes in an m{RNA}'s stability, and that this
	uncoupling can be tolerated by yeast. Copyright Â© 1999 John Wiley

  abstract = {The first step in the decay of some eukaryotic m{RNA}s is the shortening
	of the poly(A) tail. To examine how the transcript body was degraded
	after deadenylation, we followed the decay of a pulse of newly synthesized
	MFA2 transcripts while utilizing two strategies to trap intermediates
	in the degradation pathway. First, we inserted strong {RNA} secondary
	structures, which can slow exonucleolytic digestion and thereby trap
	decay intermediates, into the MFA2 5' UTR. Following deadenylation,
	fragments of the MFA2 m{RNA} trimmed from the 5' end to the site
	of secondary structure accumulated as full-length m{RNA} levels decreased.
	In addition, in cells deleted for the XRN1 gene, which encodes a
	major 5' to 3' exonuclease in yeast, the MFA2 transcript is deadenylated
	normally but persists as a full-length m{RNA} lacking the 5' cap
	structure. These results define a m{RNA} decay pathway in which deadenylation
	leads to decapping of the m{RNA} followed by 5'-->3' exonucleolytic
	degradation of the transcript body. Because the poly(A) tail and
	the cap structure are found on essentially all m{RNA}s, this pathway
	could be a general mechanism for the decay of many eukaryotic transcripts.},

	can vary by 10- to 20-fold. To determine the basis for the rapid
	degradation of the mRNA encoded by the yeast MFA2 gene we have used
	a genetic screen to isolate mutations that increase the stability
	of this transcript. Analysis of point mutations obtained from this
	screen, and of additional lesions constructed in vitro, indicated
	that the MFA2 3'-untranslated region (UTR) contains sequences that
	specify rapid mRNA decay. Moreover, the lesions that affected mRNA
	decay rate also affected the process of mRNA deadenylation. Mutations
	in one region of the 3' UTR both decreased the rate of poly(A) shortening
	and increased the stability of an intermediate form in the decay
	pathway with an oligo(A) tail (approximately 10 nucleotides). Mutations
	in a second region primarily increased the stability of the oligo(A)
	form. These results suggest that the decay of the MFA2 mRNA initiates
	with the shortening of the poly(A) tail and there are specific sequences
	within the 3' UTR that stimulate poly(A) tail shortening as well
	as subsequent steps in the decay pathway. Given the similarity of
	this decay pathway to that seen for some mammalian mRNAs, these results
	suggest that mRNA deadenylation may be a common mechanism of mRNA
	turnover.},

	increased interest in their function and regulation. Recent data
	from us and others have shed light on the molecular machinery that
	promotes the decay of such transcripts. In the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>,
	Trf4p and Trf5p are alternative subunits of the so-called TRAMP complex,
	which degrades aberrant and short-lived RNAs. They add short poly(A)
	tails to their substrate RNAs that function as landing pads for exonucleases
	mediating RNA decay. Although alternate compositions of TRAMP complexes
	exist, the RNA substrate specificities and the processes controlled
	by them have not been determined. Applying a genome-wide approach,
	we describe overlapping yet distinct functional implications of different
	TRAMP complexes, and we demonstrate strong connections between RNA
	quality control and other RNAâ€“related processes such as telomer
	length maintenance. Moreover, our study shows that the degradation

	in budding yeast using a chemical inducer of dimerization (CID).
	In this method, a nuclear export or localization signal is reversibly
	appended to a protein of interest by the CID, which effectively places
	its subcellular location under direct control of the chemical stimulus.
	Here, we explicitly tested the ability of this system to direct the
	nucleocytoplasmic transport of a panel of 16 representative kinases
	and transcription factors. From this set, we found that 12 targets
	(75%) are susceptible to re-positioning, suggesting that this method
	might be applicable to a range of targets. Interestingly, the four
	proteins that resisted mislocalization (Fun20p, Hcm1p, Pho4p, and
	Ste12p) are known to engage in a large number of protein–protein
	contacts. We suspect that, for these highly connected targets, the
	strength of the chemical signal may be insufficient to drive mislocalization

	to this approach. Collectively, these studies provide a necessary
	framework for the design of large-scale applications.},

  abstract = {One of the major players controlling RNA decay is the cytoplasmic
	5â€²-to-3â€² exoribonuclease, which is conserved among eukaryotic
	organisms. In Arabidopsis, the 5â€²-to-3â€² exoribonuclease XRN4
	is involved in disease resistance, the response to ethylene, RNAi,
	and miRNA-mediated RNA decay. Curiously, XRN4 appears to display
	selectivity among its substrates because certain 3â€² cleavage products
	formed by miRNA-mediated decay, such as from ARF10 mRNA, accumulate
	in the xrn4 mutant, whereas others, such as from AGO1, do not. To
	examine the nature of this selectivity, transcripts that differentially
	accumulate in xrn4 were identified by combining PARE and Affymetrix
	arrays. Certain functional categories, such as stamen-associated
	proteins and hydrolases, were over-represented among transcripts
	decreased in xrn4, whereas transcripts encoding nuclear-encoded chloroplast-targeted
	proteins and nucleic acidâ€“binding proteins were over-represented
	in transcripts increased in xrn4. To ascertain if RNA sequence influences
	the apparent XRN4 selectivity, a series of chimeric constructs was
	generated in which the miRNA-complementary sites and different portions
	of the surrounding sequences from AGO1 and ARF10 were interchanged.
	Analysis of the resulting transgenic plants revealed that the presence
	of a 150 nucleotide sequence downstream from the ARF10 miRNA-complementary
	site conferred strong accumulation of the 3â€² cleavage products
	in xrn4. In addition, sequence analysis of differentially accumulating
	transcripts led to the identification of 27 hexamer motifs that were
	over-represented in transcripts or miRNA-cleavage products accumulating
	in xrn4. Taken together, the data indicate that specific mRNA sequences,
	like those in ARF10, and mRNAs from select functional categories
	are attractive targets for XRN4-mediated decay.},

	the status of the cytoplasmic cap binding complex would affect the

	rates in yeast strains that were defective in several translation
	initiation factors that are part of the cap binding complex. These

	more rapid degradation of the existing permease by promoting high
	efficiency of ubiquitination of the permease that signals its internalization.
	A direct binding of intracellular uracil to the permease is possibly
	involved in this feedback regulation, as the behavior of the permease
	is similar in mutant cells unable to convert intracellular uracil
	into UMP. We used cells impaired in the ubiquitination step to show

	cardiac transplant patients from March, 1990, through November, 2000,
	were reviewed to identify invasive pneumococcal infections after
	transplantation. Demographic, clinical and microbiologic data were
	reviewed. RESULTS: Nine (11\%) of 80 patients had 12 episodes of
	pneumococcal bacteremia for an incidence rate of 39 cases/1,000 patient
	years. Patients who were African-American, transplanted before 2
	years of age and transplanted because of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
	were at increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (P < 0.05).
	Six patients were eligible for the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide
	vaccine before their first invasive infection, but only 1 had received
	it at the recommended age. Most isolates (82\%) were penicillin-susceptible,
	and no single serotype predominated. There were 2 deaths in the study
	group, but each was unrelated to infection. Three patients (33\%)
	had recurrent invasive disease with a second serotype an average
	of 12 months after the first infection. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence
	of pneumococcal bacteremia in cardiac transplant patients is higher
	than in the general pediatric population. Risks for infection were
	being African-American, being younger than 2 years at the time of
	transplant and being transplanted because of idiopathic cardiomyopathy.
	It is plausible that pneumococcal vaccine would decrease this risk.},

	that binds the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of {RNA} polymerase
	II. We show here that Spt6 contains a tandem SH2 domain with a novel
	structure and CTD-binding mode. The tandem SH2 domain binds to a
	serine 2-phosphorylated CTD peptide in vitro, whereas its N-terminal
	SH2 subdomain, which we previously characterized, does not. CTD binding
	requires a positively charged crevice in the C-terminal SH2 subdomain,
	which lacks the canonical phospho-binding pocket of SH2 domains and
	had previously escaped detection. The tandem SH2 domain is apparently
	required for transcription elongation in vivo as its deletion in
	cells is lethal in the presence of 6-azauracil.},

	to 3' exonucleolytic degradation. The decapping enzyme that removes
	the 5' cap structure is encoded by the DCP1 gene. To understand the
	function of the decapping enzyme, we used alanine scanning mutagenesis
	to create 31 mutant versions of the enzyme, and we examined the effects
	of the mutations both in vivo and in vitro. Two types of mutations
	that affected m{RNA} decapping in vivo were identified, including
	a temperature-sensitive allele. First, two mutants produced decapping
	enzymes that were defective for decapping in vitro, suggesting that
	these mutated residues are required for enzymatic activity. In contrast,
	several mutants that moderately affected m{RNA} decapping in vivo
	yielded decapping enzymes that had at least the same specific activity
	as the wild-type enzyme in vitro. Combination of alleles within this
	group yielded decapping enzymes that showed a strong loss of function
	in vivo, but that still produced fully active enzymes in vitro. This
	suggested that interactions of the decapping enzyme with other factors
	may be required for efficient decapping in vivo, and that these particular
	mutations may be disrupting such interactions. Interestingly, partial
	loss of decapping activity in vivo led to a defect in normal deadenylation-dependent
	decapping, but it did not affect the rapid deadenylation-independent
	decapping triggered by early nonsense codons. This observation suggested

  abstract = {Summary The RNA exosome is an essential multisubunit ribonuclease
	(RNase) that contributes to cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA decay and
	quality control. The 9-subunit exosome core (Exo9) features a prominent
	central channel formed by stacked asymmetric rings of six RNase PH-like
	proteins and three S1/KH domain proteins. Exo9 is catalytically inert
	but associates with Rrp44, an endoribonuclease and processive 3â€²â†’5â€²
	exoribonuclease, and Rrp6, a distributive 3â€²â†’5â€² exoribonuclease.
	We show that Exo9 and its central channel modulate all three yeast
	exosome RNase activities because channel occlusion attenuates RNA
	binding and RNase activities inÂ vitro and fails to complement exosome
	functions inÂ vivo. We find that Rrp6 stimulates Rrp44 RNase activities
	and that Rrp6 is inhibited by a mutation in the Rrp44 exoribonuclease
	active site in 11-subunit nuclear exosomes. These results suggest
	the exosome core and central channel is essential because it modulates
	each of the known RNase activities of the yeast RNA exosome.},

  abstract = {The phosphoprotein pUL69 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which is
	a herpesvirus of considerable medical importance in immunosuppressed
	patients and newborns, has previously been identified as an early-late
	viral protein that can stimulate several viral and cellular promoters
	and thus exerts a rather broad activation pattern. To gain insight
	into the mechanism of this transactivation process, we looked for
	cellular factors interacting with pUL69 in a yeast two-hybrid screen.
	Using a B-lymphocyte cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain,
	we identified 34 clones, 11 of which comprised one distinct gene.
	Interaction with this gene turned out to be very strong, producing
	beta-galactosidase levels 100-fold greater than the background as
	measured in an ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside) assay.
	Sequencing identified this gene as the human homolog of the yeast
	factor SPT6, which is thought to be involved in the regulation of
	chromatin structure. A direct interaction of pUL69 and the carboxy
	terminus of hSPT6 could be demonstrated using in vitro pull-down
	experiments. After having generated a specific antiserum that is
	able to detect the endogenous hSPT6 protein, we were able to observe
	an in vivo interaction of both proteins by coimmunoprecipitation
	analysis. The interaction domain within pUL69 was mapped to a central
	domain of this viral protein that is conserved within the homologous
	proteins of other herpesviruses such as the ICP27 protein of herpes
	simplex virus. Internal deletions within this central domain, as
	well as a single amino acid exchange at position C495, resulted in
	a loss of interaction. This correlated with a loss of the transactivation
	potential of the respective mutants, suggesting that the hSPT6 interaction
	of pUL69 is essential for stimulating gene expression. Furthermore,
	we demonstrate that the carboxy terminus of hSPT6 also binds to histon
	H3 and that this interaction can be antagonized by pUL69. This allows
	the deduction of a model by which pUL69 acts as an antirepressor
	by competing for binding of histones to hSPT6, thereby antagonizing
	the chromatin remodeling function of this cellular protein.},

	revealed that Ccr4d regulates the expression of p21 in a p53-independent
	manner. Mechanistic studies indicated that Ccr4d strongly bound to
	the 3â€²UTR of p21 mRNA, leading to the stabilization of p21 mRNA.
	Interestingly, we found that the expression of Ccr4d is down-regulated
	in various tumor tissues. Collectively, our data indicate that Ccr4d
	functions as an anti-proliferating protein through the induction
	of cell cycle arrest via a p21-dependent and p53-independent pathway
	and suggest that Ccr4d might have an important implication in carcinogenesis.},

	We show here that mammalian Spt6 binds Ser2-phosphorylated (Ser2P)
	{RNA} polymerase II ({RNA}PII) through a primitive SH2 domain, which
	recognizes phosphoserine rather than phosphotyrosine residues. Surprisingly,
	a point mutation in the Spt6 SH2 domain (R1358K) blocked binding
	to {RNA}PIIo without affecting transcription elongation rates in
	vitro. However, HIV-1 and c-myc {RNA}s formed in cells expressing
	the mutant Spt6 protein were longer than normal and contained splicing
	defects. Ectopic expression of the wild-type, but not mutant, Spt6
	SH2 domain, caused bulk poly(A)+ {RNA}s to be retained in the nucleus,
	further suggesting a widespread role for Spt6 in m{RNA} processing
	or assembly of export-competent mRNP particles. We cloned the human
	Spt6-interacting protein, hIws1 (interacts with Spt6), and found
	that it associates with the nuclear {RNA} export factor, REF1/Aly.
	Depletion of endogenous hIws1 resulted in m{RNA} processing defects,
	lower levels of REF1/Aly at the c-myc gene, and nuclear retention
	of bulk HeLa poly(A)+ {RNA}s in vivo. Thus binding of Spt6 to Ser2-P
	{RNA}PII provides a cotranscriptional mechanism to recruit Iws1,
	REF1/Aly, and associated m{RNA} processing, surveillance, and export
	factors to responsive genes.},

	II ({RNA}PII), Spn1 is constitutively recruited to the CYC1 promoter,
	although levels of transcription from this gene, which is regulated
	postrecruitment of {RNA}PII, are low. In contrast, Spt6 appears only
	after growth in conditions in which the gene is highly transcribed.
	Spn1 recruitment is via interaction with {RNA}PII, since an spn1
	mutant defective for interaction with {RNA}PII is not targeted to
	the promoter, and Spn1 is necessary for Spt6 recruitment. Through
	a targeted genetic screen, strong and specific antagonizing interactions
	between SPN1 and genes encoding Swi/Snf subunits were identified.
	Like Spt6, Swi/Snf appears at CYC1 only after activation of the gene.
	However, Spt6 significantly precedes Swi/Snf occupancy at the promoter.
	In the absence of Spn1 recruitment, Swi/Snf is constitutively found
	at the promoter. These observations support a model whereby Spn1
	negatively regulates {RNA}PII transcriptional activity by inhibiting
	recruitment of Swi/Snf to the CYC1 promoter, and this inhibition
	is abrogated by the Spn1-Spt6 interaction. These findings link Spn1
	functions to the transition from an inactive to an actively transcribing

	that determine overall rates of transcription. We have investigated
	the effects that the DNA-to-protein ratio has on both total transcription
	and the transcription of individual genes in the unicellular eukaryote
	fission yeast. Mutants altered in cell size and those blocked in
	cell-cycle progression were used to vary the DNA-to-protein ratio
	over a 5-fold range. We found that cells of sizes within 2-fold of
	the wild-type value regulated global transcription to maintain similar
	transcription rates per protein regardless of the cellular DNA content.
	These changes in total transcription correlated with coordinated
	changes in gene occupancy by {RNA} polymerase II. In cell-cycle-arrested
	mutants exceeding a certain size, total transcription rates plateaued
	as DNA became limiting for transcription at low DNA-to-protein ratios
	[1]. Unexpectedly, expression levels of individual genes remained
	tightly coordinated with each other over the entire range of cell
	sizes. We propose that there is a coordinated, global control that
	determines the rate of transcription of most genes and that this
	control plays a role in regulating growth rate of the cell.},
